# Image Upload Feature - Todo List

1. Image Upload Form:
   - [ ] Create an HTML form for users to select an image file and enter associated text.
   - [ ] Use `<input type="file">` element for file selection.
   - [ ] Set `accept` attribute to allow only JPEG, PNG, and GIF file types.
   - [ ] Implement client-side validation to check file size (max 20 MB) before uploading.

2. Server-Side Handling:
   - [ ] Handle the image upload on the server-side when the form is submitted.
   - [ ] Check the file type and size on the server-side.
   - [ ] Verify that the uploaded file is of the allowed types (JPEG, PNG, GIF) and within the size limit.
   - [ ] Move the uploaded file to a designated directory on the server for storage.
   - [ ] Generate a unique filename for the uploaded image to avoid conflicts.
   - [ ] Store the image file path or URL in the database along with the associated post details.

3. Image Storage:
   - [ ] Create a dedicated directory on the server to store the uploaded images.
   - [ ] Ensure the directory has the necessary permissions for the server to write and read files.
   - [ ] Consider implementing a mechanism to organize the images (e.g., subdirectories based on user ID or post ID).

4. Displaying Images:
   - [ ] Retrieve the image file path or URL from the database based on the post ID.
   - [ ] Use the `<img>` tag to display the image on the post page.
   - [ ] Set the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag to the retrieved image file path or URL.
   - [ ] Apply styling or resizing to the image using CSS for consistent display.

5. Error Handling:
   - [ ] Implement error handling mechanisms for file type mismatch, file size limit exceeded, or upload failures.
   - [ ] Display appropriate error messages to the user, informing them about the specific issue.
   - [ ] Log any errors or exceptions on the server-side for debugging and monitoring.

6. Security Considerations:
   - [ ] Validate and sanitize user input to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
   - [ ] Implement measures to prevent unauthorized access to the image storage directory.
   - [ ] Consider using a CDN or cloud storage service for secure image storage and serving.

7. Testing:
   - [ ] Test the image upload feature thoroughly with different scenarios.
   - [ ] Upload valid images and verify successful storage and display.
   - [ ] Attempt to upload unsupported file types and ensure proper error handling.
   - [ ] Test with images exceeding the file size limit and check for appropriate error messages.
   - [ ] Verify the security measures are in place and functioning as expected.

8. Documentation:
   - [ ] Document the image upload feature, including the supported file types and size limit.
   - [ ] Provide instructions for users on how to upload images and any relevant guidelines.
   - [ ] Include information about the image storage location and retrieval process for developers.

9. Deployment:
   - [ ] Deploy the updated project forum with the image upload feature to the production environment.
   - [ ] Ensure the necessary server configurations and permissions are set up correctly.
   - [ ] Monitor the feature in production and address any issues or feedback that arise.
